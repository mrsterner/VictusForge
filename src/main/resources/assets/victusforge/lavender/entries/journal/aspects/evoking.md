What the {light_purple}Evoking Heart Aspect{} does when broken, {gold}spawning Vexes that defend you{} is not what makes
it special. Rather, its oddity lies in how you obtain it. Simply crafting it is not an option, as the Evoker is very
secretive about how its magic is performed. So instead what needs to be done is giving a {light_purple}Blank Heart
Aspect{} to an Evoker who will then convert it to an evoking one.

;;;;;

This process is of course not without risk, considering that Evokers tend to be quite hostile folks. However, staying
out of their sight long enough should suffice for a quick conversion.
