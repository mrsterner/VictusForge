Falling from a high place is unfortunately a common fate you might be met with on your daily travels. To circumvent the
odd cliff ending your next journey prematurely, employ the {light_purple}Light Heart Aspect{}. Should the ill-fated
situation arise, it will block all fall damage, given that it was in fact enough to break the aspect.

Do consider however, that breaking a {gold}Light Aspect{} comes with a hefty cooldown of 60 whole seconds, even if no
fall damage was blocked.
