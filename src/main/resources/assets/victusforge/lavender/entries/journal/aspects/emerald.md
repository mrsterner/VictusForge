{gold}Emerald{}, a common currency employed in villager trade, might not directly spark any associations when used as
an aspect material. For this reason, what the {light_purple}Emerald Heart Aspect{} does can seem rather random yet
fairly useful. Upon being broken it will {gold}recharge all non-active aspects by 20%{}, for free!
