As you're reading this, your mind tainted by the story of Midas and his touch of gold, you might expect something
similar from the {light_purple}Golden Heart Aspect{}. Well, I'm happy to inform you that you're in fact completely
wrong. Instead, it bestows upon you {light_purple}Absorption{} when broken. Not only that, it also applies a higher
level the further down your health bar it's located.
