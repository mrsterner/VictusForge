One of the strongest companions you can conjure is without a doubt the Iron Golem. Now, hiring one, as it were, using
conventional methods can be quite the costly affair. Fear no more, as the {light_purple}Iron Heart Aspect{} is here to
solve your problems. Upon breaking, one of these servants will be summoned, no questions asked. 


Nevertheless, be warned.

The creatures called upon by the iron aspect might not be as faithful and forgiving as the real deal. Especially
dropping low enough in health potentially angers them at you, unable to discern your deteriorating self from the average
hostile scum.
