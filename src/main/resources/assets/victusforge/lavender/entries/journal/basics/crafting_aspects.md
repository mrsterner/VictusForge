All aspects require a {light_purple}Blank Heart Aspect{} as their basic ingredient. To obtain one of these, brew up or
find a {light_purple}Potion of the Bleeding Heart{} and splash it on a {gold}hostile mob{}, then kill it while it's
affected by Heartbleed. All aspects have the way they're crafted outlined in their respective entry.
