Life can be a slippery slope sometimes, and such is the {light_purple}Icy Heart Aspect{}. While active, it sort of
freezes your feet in a tasteful way, granting the increased speed that sliding on ice provides. This does come with a
side effect however, namely precise movements might be significantly hampered.

You should also notice that when the aspect breaks, some of its internal frost cannot be contained anymore and freezes
your legs for about 10 seconds.
