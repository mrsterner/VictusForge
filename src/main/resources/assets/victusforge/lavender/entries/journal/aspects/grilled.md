The {light_purple}Grilled Heart Aspect{} is the perfect aspect for the perpetually hungry. When broken, it will quite
violently stuff a piece of finely grilled meat into your mouth. As you are probably aware, this will also saturate and
thereby heal you by a few hearts unless you're *really* hungry.
