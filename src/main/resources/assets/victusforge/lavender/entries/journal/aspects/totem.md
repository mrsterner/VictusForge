The {light_purple}Totem Aspect{} is one of the most powerful aspects you can create. When triggered, it first checks
your inventory for any {light_purple}Totems of Undying{}. Should it find one, it will consume it, restore {gold}15 HP{}
and go on cooldown for 10 seconds. If you don't have any totems, only {gold}5 HP{} will be restored and the aspect will
have a 2.5 minute cooldown.

In both of these cases, should the damage have been lethal, the health restored by the {gold}Totem Aspect{} will
{gold}save you{}.
