Victus is built around the idea of {gold}Heart Aspects{}. These are essentially secondary abilities applied
on top of your health bar, most of which activate when the heart they cover gets broken. After being broken, they have
to [recharge](^victus:basics/recharging), which takes a certain amount of time per aspect.

;;;;;

The health bar you will slowly build up while playing is {gold}kept between deaths{}. It may also exceed 10 aspects, in
which case only the first 10 will recharge and activate should you lose access to your additional hearts.

To get started, take a look at [Crafting Aspects](^victus:basics/crafting_aspects) for basics on how to obtain your
first aspect, as well as [Aspect Maintenance](^victus:basics/aspect_maintenance) before you decide which one to choose.
