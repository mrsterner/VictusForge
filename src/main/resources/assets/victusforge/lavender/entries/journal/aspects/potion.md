Even though constructed quite simply, the {light_purple}Potion Heart Aspect{} is quite the peculiar one. When first
activated, it is quite useless in fact. To begin utilizing its potential, drink a potion. It will not be applied but
instead inserted into the aspect. Neat! Now, the next time the aspect breaks it will consume the potion inside and apply
to you just as if you drank it.
