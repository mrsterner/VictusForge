To add a new aspect to your health bar, simply eat the respective item and it will go into the first free slot from the
left. You {gold}cannot add new aspects at arbitrary positions{} inside your bar, so be mindful about possible aspects
you might want to add in the future.

Removing an aspect can be done in one of two ways:

;;;;;

- Finding a {light_purple}Broken Heart{} in a {gold}Buried Treasure{} and eating it. This will deal some
  damage and remove all your aspects, giving them back in item form.

- Throwing a {light_purple}Blank Heart Aspect{black} into fire. This will create a {light_purple}Void Aspect{black}
  that, when eaten, voids the first aspect on your bar, starting from the right.{}{}{}{}
