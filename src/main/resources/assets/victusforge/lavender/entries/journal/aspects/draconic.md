The Ender Dragon's breath is known to be, umm, not entirely hygienic. For this reason, mushing it onto a heart aspect
seems like a terrible idea. Well, in practice it's not as dangerous as it sounds. In reality, correctly sanitized with
some Chorus Fruit, it's perfectly safe. When applied in this form, the {light_purple}Draconic Heart Aspect{} will spawn

;;;;;

a cloud of {gold}Dragon's Breath{} at your feet upon being damaged.
